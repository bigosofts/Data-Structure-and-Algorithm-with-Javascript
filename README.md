## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive collection of different data structures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript. It serves as a practice ground for developers who wish to improve their problem-solving skills and deepen their understanding of JavaScript.

## Features

- **Data Structures**: Implementations of fundamental data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and more.
- **Algorithms**: Includes searching, sorting, and other algorithmic techniques such as recursion, dynamic programming, and greedy algorithms.
- **Problem-Solving Patterns**: Demonstrates various patterns such as sliding window, two pointers, divide and conquer, etc.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bigosofts/Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-with-Javascript-Practice-Project.git
cd Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-with-Javascript-Practice-Project
You can install any necessary dependencies (if any) using npm or yarn:

bash
node index.js

Usage
You can explore and run the different data structures and algorithms by navigating through the project files. Each implementation is self-contained and can be tested independently.

To run a specific file, use the following command:

Contributing
